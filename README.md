# DSA-2
**Program3- Dijkstra's Algorithm**  

Features:
-Implemented with min Heap (priority queue) from Program2 and Hash Table from Program2      
-For weighted graph, user defined in input text file   
-Edge costs will be postivie integers < 1 million   
-Assumes no circuits (path that begins and ends at the same vertex)
